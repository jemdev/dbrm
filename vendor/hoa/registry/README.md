This library offers a static registry that stores key/value combinations. Any
kind of PHP variable can be stored: an array, an object, a resourceâ€¦

[Learn more](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Registry).

## Installation

With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into
your dependencies, you need to
require [`hoa/registry`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/registry):

```sh
$ composer require hoa/registry '~3.0'
```

For more installation procedures, please read [the Source
page](https://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Testing

Before running the test suites, the development dependencies must be installed:

```sh
$ composer install
```

Then, to run all the test suites:

```sh
$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run
```

For more information, please read the [contributor
guide](https://hoa-project.net/Literature/Contributor/Guide.html).

## Quick usage

As a quick example, we set an entry and retrieve it. The retrieval can be done
with a static method on the `Hoa\Registry\Registry` class and also using the
`hoa://` protocol.

```php
Hoa\Register\Registry::set('foo', 'bar');
var_dump(
    Hoa\Registry\Registry::get('foo'),
    resolve('hoa://Library/Registry#foo')
);

/**
 * Will output:
 *     string(3) "bar"
 *     string(3) "bar"
 */
```

## Documentation

The
[hack book of `Hoa\Registry`](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Registry)
contains detailed information about how to use this library and how it works.

To generate the documentation locally, execute the following commands:

```sh
$ composer require --dev hoa/devtools
$ vendor/bin/hoa devtools:documentation --open
```

More documentation can be found on the project's website:
